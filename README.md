# CATETRY

This is a web app designed to utilize open ai Chat GPT to create cat poetry based on limited inputs of the user. 

The initial build will provide some limited multiple choice inputs along with the cats name.
Future releases may include the ability to add custom text. 

The initial version is designed to drastically reduce calls to Chat GPT to avoid running costs while the idea and audience grows.
